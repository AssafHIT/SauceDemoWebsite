# SauceDemoWebsite

Welcome to the **Sauce Demo Website** repository! This project is a simple demonstration website designed to showcase my front-end development skills. It mimics the structure of an e-commerce website and includes various pages for browsing products, logging in, and checking out.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** The website is designed to work seamlessly across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **Product Page:** A page that displays a variety of products with the ability to add to a shopping cart.
- **Login Functionality:** Includes a login page where users can authenticate with a sample account.
- **Profile Page:** A user profile page with profile picture and basic information.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** For structuring the content of the pages.
- **CSS3:** For styling the website and making it responsive.
- **JavaScript:** For interactivity and client-side behavior.
- **GitHub Pages:** To host the website publicly.
